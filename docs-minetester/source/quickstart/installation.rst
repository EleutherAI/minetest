Installation
============

For normal usage it suffices to install pre-built binaries via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install minetester

Verify your installation by running

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m minetester.scripts.test_loop

You should see a window pop up with a player performing random actions in Minetest.
